I am a Robotics Researcher at [Seadronix Inc.](https://www.seadronix.com/). My research focuses on `Sensor Fusion` and `SLAM` algorithm development for autonomous vessel systems, utilizing X-band Radar, W-band Radar, and LiDAR.

Previously, I was a Post-Doctoral Researcher at the Institute of Advanced Machines and Design at Seoul National University (SNU). I obtained my Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering at SNU ([Robust Perception and Mobile Robotics Lab](https://rpm.snu.ac.kr/)), advised by [Prof. Ayoung Kim](https://ayoungk.github.io/). My doctoral research centered on Robust Radar SLAM for Maritime Environments.

I completed my M.S. and B.S. in Civil and Environmental Engineering at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST). During my Master's, I was also advised by Prof. Ayoung Kim and focused on Opti-Acoustic Underwater SLAM using style-transferred multi-modal matching. Throughout my academic and professional career, I have actively contributing to the advancement of autonomous navigation technologies from the underwater to surface, full maritime autonomy.
